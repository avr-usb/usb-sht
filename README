Project is to demonstrate AVR ATmega8 running V-USB stack communication with Sensirion SHT-1x Humidity and Temperature Sensor

Once you build the circuit according the schematics, and upload the firmware using "make flash", then you can run python script with various parameters and watch the output.

This whole project is really simple and meant to be a starting point for more complex projects. If you find it useful, let me know. :-)  

$ cd python
$ ./usbsht.py echo
Echo test successful!

$ ./usbsht.py temp
Temperature : 24.38
$ ./usbsht.py hum
Relative Humidity : 50.21
$ ./usbsht.py dew
Dew Point : 13.26

$ ./usbsht.py on
$ ./usbsht.py status
LED is on
$ ./usbsht.py off
$ ./usbsht.py status
LED if off
